                Artnstock does not accept any returns unless the product
                received was damaged. All damaged products should be reported
                within 48 hours of delivery. See our policy below for original
                artwork and prints.

                Artnstock checks every print to ensure it closely resembles the
                online image. However, due to digital printing, there can be
                small variations that are beyond our control. Therefore, we do
                not accept return for prints for image differences. Returns
                would be accepted for damaged products at the time of delivery.
                Please notify the courier company at the time of delivery (this
                is very important in order for us to process the refund),
                immediately get in touch with us and send picture/video of the
                damaged product.

                If the print product is determined to have been damaged in
                transit, you would get a full credit of the product cost
                including the shipping charges. You can use this credit to order
                the same print or order a different print of an equal or higher
                value (and pay the difference).

                We would not be able to process any returns if it is not
